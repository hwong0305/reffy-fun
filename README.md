# reffy-fun

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database (optional):

```bash
bun run db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@reffy-fun/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Format and lint fix: `bun run check`

## Recommendation Sharing App

This repository now includes a full-stack recommendation sharing workflow:

- Writers can upload recommendation letters for users.
- Users can share recommendation letters with recipients by email.
- Recommendation letters require writer approval per recipient before access is granted.
- Recipients must sign in with the invited email to claim and download letters.
- Users can upload and share transcripts/resumes without writer approval.

### Key Routes

- `/` Landing page
- `/terms` Terms of Use (starter template)
- `/privacy` Privacy Policy (starter template)
- `/documents` Manage uploaded documents
- `/documents/new` Upload a document
- `/shares` Create and monitor recipient shares
- `/writer/approvals` Writer approval queue
- `/inbox` Recipient claim and download inbox

### Storage Strategy

The implementation currently stores file bytes in database BLOB storage. The API and storage layer are designed with an adapter contract so you can later switch to direct browser-to-S3 uploads using pre-signed URLs without changing client flows.

### Storage Environment Variables

Set these in `apps/server/.env`:

- `STORAGE_PROVIDER=database_blob` (default) or `s3`
- `S3_BUCKET` (required when `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`)
- `S3_REGION` (required when `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`)
- `S3_ENDPOINT` (optional for S3-compatible providers)
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (required when `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`)
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (required when `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`)
